# Simple OpenTTD Client 0.1.0 Release Notes

> **Status:** Draft â€“ Phase 3 preparation

These notes capture the highlights, fixed issues, and known limitations for the
first public preview of the Simple OpenTTD Client targeting OpenTTD 14.1
servers. The document will graduate from draft status once the Phase 3 exit
criteria described in `docs/QUALITY_ASSURANCE_PLAN.md` are satisfied.

## Highlights

- Modernised coordinator-aware launcher derived from the classic `cmclient`.
- OpenTTD 14.1 protocol compatibility covering coordinator, admin, and
  multiplayer game info exchanges.
- Updated CLI workflows with `--dump-launch-options` and
  `--dump-registration` summaries that align with the coordinator schemas.

## Fixed Issues

- Normalise configuration parsing between file-based and command-line inputs.
- Harden invite-only registration payload generation with stricter validation
  and diagnostics.

## Known Issues

- Automated gameplay scenarios that exercise a live OpenTTD server are still in
  progress. Until they land, only the CLI-focused integration tests are
  available in CI.
- Windows packaging is being stabilised; binaries built from source require the
  Visual C++ redistributables that ship with Visual Studio 2022.

## Upgrade Notes

- The client bundles a refreshed default configuration (`sotc.cfg`) that
  mirrors the 14.1 coordinator defaults. Review your existing overrides before
  upgrading.
- Saved coordinator credentials from earlier previews are invalid. Re-run the
  registration flow or update secrets via the CLI flags.

## Contributors

- Simple OpenTTD Client maintainers

## Changelog Snapshot

- Port networking stack and registration payloads to OpenTTD 14.1.
- Add CLI verbs for launch and registration dumps.
- Expand integration tests covering invalid configuration inputs.
